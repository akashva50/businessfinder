This is just a representation of how you can exploit google maps api for an industry research work.

Let's assume you are working on a competitive analysis of hospitals and rehabilitation centers in a given area and tring to establish a new similar business in that location; it could be florida or new york or anything, then you can use this code to reverse search all the hospitals and rehabilitation centers around florida and map them on a scalable js rendered browser output and find your optimal store location or where not to open a business.

Best thing is it works out of the box.Put the keywords in places text file and addresses to look around in addresses file.provide your google api in api file and then just run the script. it'll find them and map them plot them automatically; generating a csv and html output file.

so in a nutshell : it's a demo how can you grab and plot data from google maps api with python i.e find out specific places nearby around specific address around desired radius plot them on scalable map with different markers and dump details about places to an excel sheet.

**Alternatively you can also use it for searching and plotting a specific business around any locality.Ex - finding Swarovski stores all around china/india/usa**
